# Apparition

Apparition is a top down, pixel art rougue-like game. It follows the adventure of a pair of siblings, Bronagh and Ciaran, who must share a single soul after Ciaran's soul is stolen by the godess of the underworld. Follow them as they fight through descending levels of hell in their quest to get it back!

This is a short game, developed entirely by me including art, animations, and design. It has three levels with distict themes and enemies.
